      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Version notes</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Based on <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/dwpdigital7412/m/dwpdigital7412/1685006608132/c152f6e4b8ac623e7b9339e7da329f2a48e7fd90?sender=uf82923922d15a170bcd51219" target="_blank">feedback from second round of UR</a> - Tuesday 13 June to Thursday 15 June 2023 2023</li>
        <li>Changes to be tested in third round of testing, face-to-face interviews on 29 June 2023</li>
        <li><a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/RBCCC-631" target="_blank">JIRA ticket for iterations</a></li>
        <li>Added NI privacy charter link to privacy notice page</li>
        <li>Added back link out to OIDV registration and verification journey so we can test with users</li>
        <li>Removed correspondence address from overview, will add back in future to test specifically with users who have different addresses in their account</li>
        <li>Updated contact Pension Service page to reflect the latest draft proposed by GOV.UK - this draft splits the contact page into 3 separate pages covering overall pension info, claiming SP and reporting changes</li>
        <li>Added an extra GOV.UK style page to cover our need of having the contact route for accessing the online helpdesk available on GOV.UK</li>
        <li>Add an additional option as a radio button for users to select if they want to keep their current frequency - this is to address the 1 user who was unsure what to do if they didn't want to change their frequency, and to see if it clarifies that these are all of the frequency options available</li>
        <li>Added a declaration to the check answers page that is more appropriate to the change of frequency - still awaiting policy decision on whether a declaration is needed here and what it should cover, so feedback on will support further discussion</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment frequency confirmation of change scenarios</h2>
      <p>The content given to users at confirmation will depend on how close they are to their next payment, whether the payment due will be their first SP payment, and whether they will require a part payment to get onto the right schedule. All scenarios linked from the grey footer of each confirmation page.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Alternative journey - only 1 frequency option available</h2>
