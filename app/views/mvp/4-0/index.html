        <li>Iterations are based on feedback from Round 3 of UR, conducted on <a href="../3-0/index.html" target="_blank">version 3 of MVP</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RBCCC/pages/133140743260/Usability+testing+artefacts" target="_blank">Mockup of award notice letter used in round 3 of UR</a>, see round 3 version</li>
        <li><a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/RBCCC-272" target="_blank">JIRA ticket for prototype iterations</a></li>
        <li>
          Iterated the assisted digital content, as users felt the link ‘get technical help…’ was going to take them to an FAQs page or an online contact form
        </li>
        <li>  
          Users struggled to locate the relevant contact info on the existing GOV.UK page - as any changes to the GOV.UK contact page will take time to be agreed and implemented, we have created our own iteration to be part of our service in Private Beta so we can test iterations and provide evidence to GOV.UK for recommended changes
        </li>
        <li>
          Removed change links from sections that can’t be updated yet as the extra info page did NOT help users tie back to the info they had seen in the letter and start page, so still felt they were told they could make more changes than just bank details
        </li>
        <li>
          Added extra content to 'Your State Pension' page to lay out that this is a new service only offering one change currently - confirmed that users are reading info at top of screen, so should help set expectations for those who have not absorbed the info from letter or start page
        </li>
        </ul>
      <p>Other changes based on feedback outside UR</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Start page - Removed single bullet point as it does not follow style guide (also removed from Award letter)</li>
        <li>Start page - Reworded opening paragraphs to align with changes to Award Letter (after session with comms)</li>
        <li>Your State Pension - Updated content under 'This is a new service' to match up with 'Bank or building society' heading</li>
        <li>Mocked up service unavailable pages to help with dev build - Tweaked how we point to phones as users may confuse what we mean regarding ‘reporting a change’.</li>
        <li>
          Added Welsh toggle throughout service to help with dev build - toggle in service pages, and text link in mock GOV.uk pages to follow patterns
        </li>
        <li>
          Added sign out links where applicable to help with dev build - followed HMRC design system pattern as it has been thoroughly tested and is used in many live services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updated bank validation error messages to align with exactly what will be needed for the dev build
        </li>
        <li>
          Mocked up version of Your State Pension page which shows correspondence address if different from residential address, to support dev build
        </li>
        <li>
          Added NI contact links to pages before login, as we won't know where the user is based at those points
        </li>
        <li>
          Added NI pages for pages where content will differ (does not include NI pages where only links differ)
        </li>
        <li>
          Updated page names to follow the URLs that will be used in live to support dev build
        </li>
        <li>
          Updated all ESW contact links to point to our iteration of the GOV.UK contact page, so that we can gather as much user feedback on it as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          Added NI pages for pages where content will differ (does not include NI pages where only links differ)
        </li>
        <li>Updated signed out pages to talk about 'starting again' to return to the beginning of the service after sign out - originally mentioned 'signing in', but OIDV functionality means the user has to be sent back to the start of the consuming service</li>
        <li>Added stripped back MVP version of confirmation page - tighter delivery deadlines meant date logic needed to be removed from content, but will be completed in post-MVP iteration to improve user experience.</li>
